  probably not. we should store this informatoin
  with the user.
  user.priority = {
    card1: 100,
    card2: 200,
    card3: 94
  }
  this means user needs to review card2, card1, and card3.
  is this necessary? (y/n)
  is this efficient? (y/n)

  what happens when a user hasn't logged in for so long
  that every card needs to be "urgently reviewed"?
  how do we prioritize between all cards?
  once we answer the cards, the prioritize function
  will properly set the next interval.
  some of the cards will reappear next week while others
  that we have mastered will show up in 2 yrs.

  Do we need to include a "difficulty" level on each
  card?
  >> user votes on difficulty
  >> author sets difficulty
  >> overall % of people that get it correct
