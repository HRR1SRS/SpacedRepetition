# HR SRS: Spaced Repetition System #

Review material faster, better than before by seeing them *only* when you need to.

HR SRS allows you to review "flashcards" made by you or other users. Using a Spaced Repetition algorithm, we'll show material you've mastered less frequently so you have time to focus on areas of improvement.

It's easy to get started. Go to http://hr-srs.meteor.com/ and start creating or reviewing cards!
